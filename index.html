    <section id="info-we-collect">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information in three ways: (a) information you provide, (b) information collected automatically, and (c) information from third parties (such as analytics or sign-in providers), depending on the features you choose to use.</p>
      <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account & Profile</strong> (optional): display name, avatar, email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity Content</strong>: routes, notes, photos you upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Messages</strong>: inquiries sent to our support email.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise Location (GPS)</strong>: to record routes, distance, pace, elevation, and map your rides/hikes. If enabled, location may be collected while the app is in use; <em>if you enable background tracking</em>, location may be collected in the background to complete an uninterrupted activity log.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion & Fitness Data</strong>: step count, cadence, altitude/elevation (e.g., via barometer), and device motion where supported and permitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & Usage</strong>: device model, OS version, app version, language, crash logs, performance data, and in-app actions for diagnostics and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Data</strong>: IP address and general location derived from IP for fraud prevention and analytics.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>C. Information from Third Parties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics & Diagnostics</strong>: app usage metrics to improve stability and features.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign-In Providers</strong> (if available): basic profile info from the provider after your consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Backup/Sync</strong> (if enabled): user content required to deliver synchronization across devices.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-we-use">
      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services and app features (e.g., route tracking, statistics, leaderboards if offered).</li>
        <li>Show activity history, progress, and personalized insights.</li>
        <li>Process your requests and provide customer support.</li>
        <li>Monitor and enhance safety, integrity, performance, and security.</li>
        <li>Send service-related notifications (e.g., activity summaries, policy updates). You can control non-essential notifications via device settings.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Legal bases for users in the EEA/UK/Switzerland</em>: performance of a contract (to provide the Services), legitimate interests (e.g., security, improvements), consent (e.g., precise location, background tracking, marketing), and legal obligations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sharing">
      <h2>3. Sharing & Disclosures</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: vendors that host data, provide analytics, crash reporting, or support services, bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Direction</strong>: when you choose to share routes, stats, or content with friends or social platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal & Safety</strong>: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights, property, safety of users or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: as part of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to this Policy or a successor policy with notice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Third-Party SDKs</strong> we may use include analytics (e.g., Firebase Analytics), crash reporting (e.g., Crashlytics), and performance monitoring. These providers may process limited device and usage data to deliver their services. Specific SDKs and their data practices may be listed in-app or on our website, and may change over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="permissions">
      <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
      <p>Some features require you to grant device permissions. You can revoke permissions at any time in your device settings, but certain features may stop working.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location</strong> (Precise & Approximate): track routes, distance, pace, elevation, and display maps. Background location is used only if you explicitly enable background tracking to record continuous activities when the app is not in the foreground.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion/Fitness</strong>: improve distance/elevation estimation and activity detection where available.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos/Media/Files</strong>: save maps or let you attach photos to activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: send timely updates such as activity summaries and reminders. You control notification categories in settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> (optional): connect to sensors (e.g., heart rate, cadence) where supported.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Typical examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account data: retained until you delete your account or after a period of inactivity per our internal policies.</li>
        <li>Activity records: kept until you delete them or your account, unless required for safety, security, or legal reasons.</li>
        <li>Crash/diagnostic logs: kept for a limited time needed for troubleshooting and quality assurance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
